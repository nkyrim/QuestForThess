# Quest for Thessaloniki
Android application for the contest Apps4Thessaloniki Tourism Edition

The purpose of the application is to "gamify" the experience of visitors in Thessaloniki. Instead of being just a tourist guide the app allows the user to select specific "points of interest" that he wants to visit and the user begins his quest to complete his objectives.
There are two kinds of objectives:
- Visiting some POI. The app notifies the user when he is close to it, based on the location of the POI and the user's current location. The objective is registered as completed when the user actually gets there, i.e his "really" close to the location.
- Scanning the QR codes set by the project ThessWiki(http://thesswiki.com/)

Achievements can be completed and shared after some amount of quests has been completed.

This application was created for the "Apps4Thessaloniki-Tourism Edition" contest in 2016. We ended up pretty low on the ranking( second to last :) ) but the contest itself was a great experience... and fun! Even though we decided to participate early in the process we didn't manage to start working on it just days before the deadline. Three days of day-long coding and one day to actually field test the app, both tiring and exciting at the same time!

Although the app hasn't actually been updated with new features since its creation in 2016 I have updated the code to build and work properly with a target API of 28(Pie)
